UBC CPSC 310 Insight Facade course project

## Configuring your environment

To start using this project, you need to get your computer configured so you can build and execute the code.
To do this, follow these steps; the specifics of each step (especially the first two) will vary based on which operating system your computer has:

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (v2.9+). After installing you should be able to execute `git --version` on the command line.

1. [Install Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v10.14.X), which will also install NPM (you should be able to execute `node --version` and `npm --version` on the command line).

1. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (v1.12+). You should be able to execute `yarn --version` afterwards.

1. Clone your repository by running `git clone REPO_URL` from the command line. You can get the REPO_URL by clicking on the green button on your project repository page on GitHub.

## Project Commands

Once your project is configured you need to further prepare the project's tooling and dependencies. In the cpsc310project folder (on OS X / Linux):

- yarn run clean

- yarn install

- yarn run build

If you use Windows; instead try (and hope):

- yarn run cleanwin

- yarn install

- yarn run build

## Executing the test suite

The sample project ships with some automated unit tests. These commands will execute the suites:

Test: yarn run test (or yarn test)

Test coverage: yarn run cover (or yarn run coverwin if you use Windows). HTML reports can be found: ./coverage/lcov-report/index.html

You can also run the tests as a Mocha target inside your favourite IDE (WebStorm and VSCode both work well and are free for academic use); some students are also using Atom and Cloud9 (although this will require a bit of fiddling since it runs in the cloud).

Executing the private test suite

To invoke the private suite, add a @autobot mention to any commit in your main branch in Github. Remember: these are rate limited so choose your commits wisely. Additional details can be found in the AutoTest documentation.

## Starting the server

- yarn run start

## Developing your project

As you change your TypeScript code you will have to re-compile. This can be done with yarn run build to build the system and get it ready to execute. You should always fix any compilation errors shown in this step; this is required for AutoTest to succeed. New unit tests can be written and added to /test.

## Running and testing from an IDE

While these instructions are for WebStorm, other IDEs (e.g., VSCode, Atom, etc.) and editors (e.g., Sublime) should be similar, or will at least be compatible with the command line options described above.

To run or test the system in WebStorm you will need to configure run targets:

To run the system: Go to the Run->Edit Configurations and tap on the + and then Node.js. Point the 'JavaScript file' argument to src/App.js.

To run unit tests: Go to the Run->Edit Configurations and tap on the + and then Mocha. Point the 'Test Directory' file argument to test/. You can also optionally tap the + in the Before launch box and select Compile TypeScript if you want to make sure a fresh TypeScript compile is forced before each test run.
